z26 compiles and runs natively on FreeBSD 4.9. You'll need gmake, nasm,
sdl12, and sdl_ldbad from ports/devel. You specifically can't use
the native BSD make. Use `gmake freebsd' to build.

At some point I'd like to test FreeBSD 5.2.1, and also try to get
RTC timing to work (via ports/emulators/rtc).

Once we make a stable release of the nasm version of z26, I'd like
to get it into FreeBSD's ports (possibly also Net and OpenBSD).
