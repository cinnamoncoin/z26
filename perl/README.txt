These are specially modified versions of pod2text and pod2pdf, for use
with z26 only. Actually, this pod2text hasn't been modified, but it may
be in the future. For the real versions:

- pod2text comes with the standard Perl distribution. See www.perl.com.
- pod2pdf was installed from CPAN. See
  http://search.cpan.org/~ajfry/Pod-Pdf-1.2/

These programs are originally distributed under the terms of the Perl
Artistic License, a copy of which can be seen at
